  ## Description
  This project was meant to allow users to create, save, and view saved notes on a webpage. I attempted to do this with the start code provided, which is based off of vanilla javascript. I tried to create a click event on a dynamically generated element, but this does not work. I tried converting the index.js file to jquery, but this seemed like something I shouldnt need to do as this was provided starter code. I am turning this in now to accept whatever grade I can get, then I will follow up with a ta or instructor on how exactly to accomplish this. Right now, the save button works in a way, as it will save notes and display them on refresh.
